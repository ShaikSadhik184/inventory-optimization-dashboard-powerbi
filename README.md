# Inventory Optimization Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a real-world Business Intelligence workflow where a Power BI
dashboard was developed using SQL Server test data and later migrated to a MySQL
production environment without rebuilding the report.

## Business Problem
Inventory mismanagement can lead to supply shortages, revenue loss, and inefficient
operations. This dashboard helps stakeholders monitor demand, availability, shortages,
and financial impact to make data-driven decisions.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- SQL Server (Test Environment)
- MySQL (Production Environment)
- Power Query
- DAX

## Data Architecture
- Initial development using SQL Server test database
- Final production deployment using MySQL
- Schema consistency maintained to enable seamless migration

## Key KPIs
- Average Demand per Day
- Average Availability per Day
- Total Supply Shortage
- Total Profit
- Total Loss
- Average Daily Loss

## Data Source Migration (Key Highlight)
- Report developed on SQL Server test data
- Client requirement changed to MySQL
- Data source updated using Power BI without rebuilding visuals or DAX
- KPIs validated post-migration to ensure accuracy

## Validation Steps
- Row count comparison
- KPI reconciliation
- Filter and aggregation checks

## Dashboard Pages
### Page 1 – Inventory Overview
- Demand vs Availability
- Supply Shortage indicators

### Page 2 – Financial Impact
- Total Profit
- Total Loss
- Average Daily Loss

## Outcome
- Zero report redevelopment
- Faster production deployment
- Scalable and reusable BI solution
